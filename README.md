# Document Q&A Bot (Groq-powered)

This project is a Streamlit-powered web application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about the content. The bot uses advanced natural language processing with the LangChain and Groq libraries to provide accurate answers.

## Features

- **PDF Document Upload**: Users can upload PDF documents for processing.
- **Document Chunking**: Splits the document into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Creates vector embeddings using HuggingFace models.
- **Q&A Retrieval**: Provides answers to user queries based on the uploaded document's content.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload**: The user uploads a PDF document.
2. **Processing**: The document is split into manageable chunks and embedded using a pre-trained HuggingFace model.
3. **Vector Storage**: The chunks are stored in an in-memory Qdrant vector store.
4. **Q&A**: Users can ask questions, and the system retrieves relevant information using Groq's LLM.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to Groq's LLM (API key or authentication as required)
- `sentence-transformers` for embeddings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/document-qa-bot.git
   cd document-qa-bot
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following:
     ```env
     GROQ_API_KEY=<your-groq-api-key>
     ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upload a PDF document using the file uploader.
2. Once the document is processed, type a question in the input box.
3. View the answer generated by the bot.
